Expense Oganizer
================

Epicodus exercise

* As a user, I want to enter an expense, so I can keep track of where I'm spending my money. I should be able to provide a description (for example, "Burgers"), an amount ($7.56), and the date I made the purchase.

* As a user, I want to choose a single category for each expense, so I can label out where I'm spending my money.
